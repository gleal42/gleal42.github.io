## Welcome to my page

My name is Gon√ßalo Leal.

I'm a passionate International Business & Strategy, Management and Economics Graduate (Lancaster University Management School, Catolica Porto Business School and FEP, respectively), who, after taking part in a 6-month internship experience at Warner Music Group through the program Inov Contacto, helping the Business Development and New Business and Ventures team is ready for the next challenge in a dynamic industry.

I'm focused on adding value to the world through a positive impact on all the people that interact with me in any way and through the hard work I put into what I do. I love to create content and to challenge myself.

I'm also extremely passionate about technology and learning. While I am searching for the next great opportunity, I'm learning how to code at School 42, considered by many the best coding school in the world, with a very effective and flexible learning style. I believe that with these new digital tools I will play a much more active role, in the near future, which is dominated by new technologies and business models.
